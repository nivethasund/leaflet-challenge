## Module 15 Challenge Files

The map is also available for viewing on the following link - [here](https://nivethasund.github.io/leaflet-challenge/){:target="_blank"} 

This repo contains
- An index.html file containing code that helps users visualize the Earthquake data
- A static folder containing
    - The logic_map.js file that uses D3 and Leaflet to create a map using GeoJSON data
    - The style.css file that generates the look of our html code.
- An Images folder showing screenshots of the map created

## The Leaflet Challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. On their website, we extract earthquake data from a geojson link containing data of "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days", and use it with D3 and Leaflet to help visualize the impact of these earthquakes (with depth and magnitude) on a map.

With my knowledge of Javascript and HTML/CSS, we create markers proportionate to the magnitude for each of these earthquakes across the world, and color code them based on depth. We also manually input a legend to easily identify the range of impact.

I've heavily relied on the code used in our in-class assignments, as well as the Leaflet documentation.
